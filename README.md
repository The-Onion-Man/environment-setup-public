## Setting up your Dev Environment

First things first, you’ll need to set up your dev environment and install the software that you’ll be using during your time at Codesmith and beyond. We recommend following all of the below steps to fully set up your environment before you begin working. Although you won’t be using all of these things right now, they’ll be necessary to have during the program - it’s best to get a head start so that you’re able to come into the program with everything working ahead of time.

### What OS should I be using?
- If you're using Mac OS, you're going to be okay. We use macs here, too!
- Linux users, you have nothing to fear either.
- If you're using Windows, we recommend installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You can find instructions in the guide below.

For instructions on environment setup, please follow whichever of the below links applies to you.

- [Environment setup for Windows OS](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/dev-environment-setup/blob/main/windows-os.md)

### You Need To Learn The Command Line

Still using the Windows Explorer or Mac Finder? These tools have a graphical interface (pictures of folders and files). However, many of the tools you'll use as a developer lack a nice graphical user interface (GUI). In order to use them, you'll need to be familiar with the command line. This is a management interface using only text. Don't worry! Once you get used to it, you'll find it makes your life much easier. You can use any resources you like. We recommend reading these.

### You Need To Know How To Use GitHub

It is important that you get familiar with GitHub. For the precourse and throughout the program, you will access all challenges and submit your complete work through GitHub. The way we use GitHub is slightly different so make sure you read the ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/dev-environment-setup/blob/main/Github.md) file to get yourself familiar with the processes. Some knowledge of the command line will be necessary. Also, Github is very popular among well-known companies and knowing how to use it will undoubtedly be a great skill for you in the future.

In addition, here is a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc).
Or if you prefer, go directly to the source and [read the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)!
One other thing to note, git uses text editor called VIM which comes with it's own quirks. While not required, it is very helpful to be familiar with [basic commands](https://staff.washington.edu/rells/R110/). Or if you prefer online games <https://vim-adventures.com/>.
