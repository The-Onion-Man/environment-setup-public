## Setting up your Dev Environment

First things first, you’ll need to set up your dev environment and install the software that you’ll be using during your time at Codesmith and beyond. We recommend following all of the below steps to fully set up your environment before you begin working. Although you won’t be using all of these things right now, they’ll be necessary to have during the program - it’s best to get a head start so that you’re able to come into the program with everything working ahead of time.

For instructions on environment setup, please follow whichever of the below links applies to you.
